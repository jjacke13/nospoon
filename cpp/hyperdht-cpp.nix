# hyperdht-cpp — C++ port of HyperDHT, the P2P DHT layer below nospoon.
#
# Built as a shared library with the full C++ API exported (not just the
# C FFI) so that nospoon-cpp can link against internal classes like
# `HyperDHT`, `Server`, `SecretStreamDuplex` etc.
#
# The repo bundles libudx as a git submodule under `deps/libudx`. We
# pull it in with `fetchSubmodules = true`; CMake builds it statically
# and folds it into libhyperdht.
